# About

Hi,

My name is Usman Siddiqui and I am currently a third year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto.

I am passionate about programming, developing new innovative things, working on large projects and staying up to date with the latest technologies.

I have extensive experience with many programming languages and have worked in teams where we followed various software engineering principles.

I have performed automation scripting and QA automation development for International Financial Data Services.

I have developed a dynamic web application for a business team at Ontario's Ministry of Education using Angular, Typescript, Node.js and Sharepoint.

My hobbies include going to the gym, swimming, playing basketball and watching youtube videos on the newest technologies.
